I genuinely tried Genetic Algorithm Optimization and Ant_colony Optimizatiion but i couldn't come up with the desired result, but i will soon. Still i came up with func calls for PSO AND CA.

INNFERENCES:
1. GA is generally effective at finding good solutions but can be slow and may get stuck in local optima.
2. ACO can handle complex search spaces but may be sensitive to the parameters .
