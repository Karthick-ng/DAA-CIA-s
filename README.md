CIA-1
I used specific instance of the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm for alignment,
Since i couldn't finish the exam on time, i am uploading the complete code here with alignment matrix, scores.
I completely accept that , i got help help from youtube to complete this code(backtracking), but generating sequence and allignment matrix is my work and i did that honestly.
My code is uploaded as DAA CIA-1
I assumed my gap score as -1 and computed the alogorithm

CIA-2
Codebase for all four algorithms and readme file(inside it)(please refer to it)
